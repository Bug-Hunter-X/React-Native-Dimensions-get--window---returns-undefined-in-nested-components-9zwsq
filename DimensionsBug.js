This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially within a component that is not directly rendered in the main app view hierarchy.

```javascript
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

// ... component using width and height ...
```

The problem is that `Dimensions.get('window')` might return `undefined` initially, particularly if the component is being rendered inside a modal, a navigation component, or another nested element.

The issue arises because the dimensions might not be available immediately when the component mounts. This leads to errors when the component tries to access `width` and `height` before they've been populated.
